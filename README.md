In the everyday life of modern societies, search engines represent one of the most important sources of information and assume a gatekeeper function. 
The automatic completion of search terms by the underlying algorithms can have an impact on individuals and society as a whole and negatively influence them. 
This thesis for the “DIS25 - Natural Language Processing” module explores the different representation of different religions in search completions. 
The goal of the group "PowerPuff" (Diana Disterhof, Anna Schmer, Burak Tanriver, Luisa Strassburger) is to work out an analysis regarding the research question and the topic Ethnical Bias with the ESUPOL Minorities Dataset.
